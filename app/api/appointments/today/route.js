/**
 * API Route: Today's Schedule
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * This API endpoint retrieves all appointments scheduled for the current day
 * for the logged-in user. It filters appointments to only show those occurring
 * today (from midnight to 11:59:59 PM) and returns them sorted by time.
 * 
 * HTTP Method: GET
 * Endpoint: /api/appointments/route.js
 * 
 * Returns:
 * - Success (200): Array of today's appointments with client information
 * - 404: If the authenticated user doesn't exist in the database
 * - 500: If any server error occurs
 * 
 * Use Case:
 * This endpoint powers a "Today's Schedule" dashboard widget or page that shows
 * users what appointments they have scheduled for the current day. Common in
 * healthcare, scheduling, and calendar applications.
 * 
 * Key Features:
 * - Automatically calculates "today" based on server time
 * - Includes full client information for each appointment
 * - Sorts appointments chronologically (earliest first)
 * - Formats dates for easy frontend consumption
